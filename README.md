## Authentication (MVP)

Email + password auth (in-memory) is implemented.

```json
{
  "name": "Mame Mor",
  "email": "test@cars221.sn",
  "password": "123456"
}
{
  "email": "test@cars221.sn",
  "password": "123456"
}
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Make sure the first line starts with **three backticks** like:
\`\`\`json

and ends with three backticks \`\`\`

---

So final structure should look like:

**Signup**
- endpoint
- body JSON

**Login**
- endpoint
- body JSON

**Get current user**
- endpoint
- header example

---

After you fix it and commit — reply:

**README fixed**

Then we move to the next GitHub-only task:  
creating `legal/terms.md`.
